🧠 Online Payments Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
📌 Overview

This project aims to detect fraudulent online payment transactions using various Machine Learning algorithms. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate, helping financial institutions prevent fraud in real-time.

🎯 Objective

Analyze the dataset and identify patterns that indicate fraudulent activity.

Train and compare different ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Tree).

Evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualize insights from the dataset using matplotlib and seaborn.
